<h1>Negative Selection Algorithm for Android Ransomware detection</h1>
This is the algorithm prototype using Python. This is a draft of the finished version that can be found <a href=https://github.com/vz000/android-ransomware-detection>here</a>.
<h2>April 2023 Note</h2>
Automated apk downloads using Selenium is no longer supported. The site where applications can be downloaded is constantly changing to avoid automated behaviours.

The script under <a href=https://github.com/vz000/NSAlgorithm-Prototype/tree/main/apkDownload>apkDownload</a> no longer works and needs continuous changes (that I won't be working on).
